# Lab | Introduction to A/B Testing  

## Introduction

A/B testing is a fundamental data science technique used to compare two versions of a product, webpage, or feature to determine which performs better. In `main.ipynb`, you’ll apply statistical methods—including hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, and power analysis—to severals datasets, simulating the decision-making process of a data analyst. By working through these tasks, you’ll gain hands-on experience in designing experiments, analyzing results, and drawing actionable insights.  

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
